<!-- EMPOWER_ORCHESTRATOR:START -->
Factory automation is allowed only when the operator can still understand and recover from what is about to happen.
Before dispatching automation or creating a durable system change, state the four-question blast-radius check:

1. **Scale** — how many repositories, files, jobs, runners, users, or environments can this touch?
2. **Severity** — what is the worst plausible breakage if this is wrong?
3. **Reversibility** — how quickly can the operator roll it back or stop it?
4. **Predictability** — is the system deterministic enough to trust unattended execution?

If any answer is unclear, narrow the action, add a dry run, or require explicit operator confirmation before continuing.

# Liminal — Project Instructions

## Mandatory Coding Skill

All coding, review, and refactor work in this repo must follow `karpathy-guidelines`.

If the runtime supports local skills, load and apply `karpathy-guidelines` directly. If it does not, still follow the same rules:
1. Think before coding and surface assumptions/tradeoffs.
2. Prefer the simplest sufficient change.
3. Make surgical edits only.
4. Define concrete verification criteria before claiming success.

## Git Hygiene (mandatory for all agents)

This repo has multiple agents working simultaneously in worktrees. Breaking these rules causes data loss and merge conflicts.

### The 6 Rules

1. **Always push after committing.** Run `git push` immediately after every commit. Unpushed commits on a worktree that gets cleaned up = lost work. No exceptions.
2. **Clean up your worktree when done.** After your work is pushed and/or merged: remove the worktree (`git worktree remove <path>`), delete your local branch if merged, delete remote branch if merged. Never leave idle worktrees behind.
3. **Start fresh branches after merges.** If your branch was merged (squash or otherwise) to main, do NOT continue committing on it. Checkout main, pull, create a new branch. Continuing on merged branches creates divergence.
4. **Check the monitor log.** Before starting work, read `memory/git-monitor-log.md` to see what other agents are doing. Avoid stepping on active worktrees.
5. **Commit incrementally.** Don't let 20+ files sit dirty. Commit in logical batches (every 5-10 files). Large uncommitted diffs make conflict resolution harder.
6. **Clean up stashes at session end.** Git stashes are repo-global (not per-worktree). Test runners using `auto-stash` pile up fast — 90+ stashes from a single test session is typical. Before closing a session: `git stash list` → drop all `liminal: auto-stash` entries with `git stash drop stash@{N}`. Keep only stashes with meaningful WIP. If the stash list exceeds 10 entries, it's overdue for cleanup.

### Parallel Agent Isolation (mandatory)

When launching 2+ agents for parallel work, you MUST use the /team skill:
```
/oh-my-claudecode:team "description of parallel work"
```

`/team` creates isolated git worktrees per worker and handles merging.
Never launch 2+ parallel Task() calls directly — they share the working directory and will collide.

Single-agent tasks (one-off investigation, single-file edits) may use Task() directly.

### Convention Violation Monitor

A cron job scans every 5 minutes and logs violations to `memory/git-monitor-log.md`. Violations are flagged as:
- **HIGH** — Data loss risk (unpushed work, diverged branches)
- **MEDIUM** — Hygiene (idle worktrees, main behind remote)
- **LOW** — Naming, stale branches

If you see your worktree flagged, fix it immediately.

## Test Quality Standards (mandatory for all agents)

Every test file written or modified MUST meet these standards. No exceptions.

### The 7 Rules

1. **Assert outcomes, not process.** Test what the code *returns/does*, not which internal functions it calls. `expect(result.score).toBe(0.8)` not `expect(mockFn).toHaveBeenCalled()`.

2. **No `toBeDefined()` / `toBeTruthy()` / `toBeGreaterThan(0)` alone.** Every assertion must check a specific expected value or a tight range. If you can't name the expected value, the test isn't testing anything.

3. **`vi.hoisted()` is mandatory** for any mock variable referenced inside `vi.mock()` factories. Vitest hoists `vi.mock()` above all `const` declarations — plain variables cause `ReferenceError: Cannot access before initialization`.

4. **Mock at boundaries, not internals.** Mock external deps (LLM APIs, filesystem, network). Never mock the module under test. If you're mocking 5+ internal modules, the test proves nothing — refactor to test at a higher level.

5. **Mock API contracts must match reality.** `rateLimiter.execute()` returns `{ result: T }`, not `T`. `telemetryWrapper.wrap()` calls `tool.execute(params)`. A mock that returns the wrong shape passes tests but proves nothing.

6. **Test error paths, not just happy paths.** Every module must have at least one test for: empty input, null/undefined, thrown errors, failed operations. If only happy-path tests exist, the file is WEAK.

7. **Integration tests must integrate.** A file in `test/integration/` must exercise ≥2 real modules together with real data flowing between them. Tests that import a single module and call it in isolation are unit tests — put them in `test/unit/`.

### Test Quality Ratings

| Rating | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| GOOD | Behavioral assertions, real data flow, error paths covered | Ship it |
| ADEQUATE | Tests real behavior but gaps in assertions or error paths | Fix before merge |
| WEAK | Tests private methods, over-mocked, trivial assertions | Rewrite required |
| PADDING | Only constructor + report tests | Do not commit |

### Coverage Target (MANDATORY — all agents)

**Target: 70% coverage across all 4 metrics.**

| Metric | Current | Target | Gap |
|--------|---------|--------|-----|
| Statements | 67.4% | 70% | -2.6pp |
| Branches | 57.3% | 70% | -12.7pp |
| Functions | 68.2% | 70% | -1.8pp |
| Lines | 68.2% | 70% | -1.8pp |

*(Current values auto-update via the ratchet. This table reflects the gap at ratchet start.)*

**Rules:**
1. Every new `src/` file MUST include a corresponding test file. Zero-coverage files are CI failures.
2. Every PR that modifies `src/` code MUST not decrease coverage. The ratchet enforces this.
3. When writing tests, target the 70% threshold — not the current ratchet floor. Write tests that move the needle.
4. Priority modules for coverage investment: `src/music/`, `src/plugins/`, `src/config/`, `src/generators/` — these have the largest gaps.
5. `toBeDefined()` usage MUST stay below 5% of total assertions per file. Use `toBe(expectedValue)` or `toEqual(expectedShape)` instead.
6. The ratchet (`autoUpdate` in `vitest.config.ts`) is the enforcement mechanism. **Never manually lower thresholds.** They only go UP.

**Quality checker** (`pnpm test:quality`) enforces: vi.hoisted compliance, no weak assertions, no padding tests.
**CI pipeline** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) enforces: coverage ratchet, quality checker, coverage gap detection.
**Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`) enforces: related-file tests pass before commit.

### Enforcement

- **ESLint custom rules** in `eslint-rules/` catch `vi.hoisted` violations and weak assertions at lint time
- **Vitest coverage ratchet** (`autoUpdate: true` in `vitest.config.ts`) ensures coverage only goes UP
- **Pre-commit hook** (`.githooks/pre-commit`) runs `vitest --related` for staged source files
- **Quality checker** (`scripts/testing/test-quality-check.mjs`) enforces assertion quality standards
- **CI coverage gate** (`scripts/ci/check-coverage-gaps.ts`) blocks on zero-coverage files

## Archaeology — MOVED TO SEPARATE REPO

The archaeology pipeline has been extracted to **`dev-archaeology`** (private repo).
- **Repo:** `~/workspaces/dev-archaeology/`
- **GitHub:** `https://github.com/Pastorsimon1798/dev-archaeology`
- **Liminal data:** `projects/liminal/` inside that repo

**DO NOT** create archaeology files, run archaeology scripts, or reference `narrative/data/` in this repo. All archaeology work happens in `dev-archaeology`.

The `narrative/` directory has been removed. Git history is preserved on the `narrative/liminal-archaeology` branch.

## Git Workspace Hygiene (Org-Wide Rule)

Agents must leave the repository in the same clean state they found it. No exceptions.

- **Delete feature branches** after merge — whether you merged via PR or locally. A merged branch that still exists is a failure.
- **Remove worktrees** when done. If you created a git worktree for isolated work, remove it when the work is complete or abandoned. No orphaned worktrees.
- **Clean up stale references** — prune remote-tracking branches that no longer exist upstream (`git remote prune origin`).
- **No abandoned work left behind** — if you started a branch, pushed it, and then the task was cancelled or superseded, delete the branch. Dead branches accumulate and confuse everyone.
- **Local branches stay current** — regularly rebase local tracking branches against their upstream. If a local branch has diverged and is no longer needed, delete it.
- **Worktree state matches intent** — if you're done with a task, the working directory should be clean (`git status` shows nothing). Staged changes, untracked files, and modified files from abandoned work are not acceptable.

The rule is simple: finish your work, merge or discard it, clean up every artifact you created. The main branch is the only permanent artifact. Everything else is temporary and must be treated as such.

## Epoch Data Tracking (Org-Wide Rule)

Every project must use Epoch (KyaniteLabs/Epoch) for time estimation and actively feed it data. Epoch only becomes useful when it has real estimate-vs-actual data from real projects.

### What This Means
- **Before starting a task**, get a time estimate from Epoch (via MCP, REST API at `localhost:3099`, or CLI)
- **After completing a task**, record the actual time spent using `record_actual` or `POST /v1/feedback/record-actual`
- **Include context** — task type, complexity, tools used, anything that helps the model learn
- **Batch submissions are fine** — use `batch_record_actuals` for multiple estimates at once

### Integration
- MCP: add `@puenteworks/epoch` to your project's `.mcp.json`
- REST API: `epoch serve --port 3099`
- CLI: `npx @puenteworks/epoch pert-estimate ...`

### Why This Is Non-Negotiable
Epoch's accuracy improves with data. Without estimate-vs-actual feedback from real projects, it's just a calculator with uncalibrated assumptions. Every project that uses Epoch and reports back makes every other project's estimates better. This is a collective intelligence system — it only works if everyone contributes.

The data stored in `~/.epoch/` (estimates.jsonl + feedback.jsonl) is the project's most valuable asset. Protect it, back it up, and keep feeding it.

## Integration-First Rule (mandatory for all agents)

1. No new module may be created without a specific call site in the existing CLI or loop.
2. Every task must end with a verifiable CLI command or test run.
3. Orphaned files (created but never imported) are defects — the pre-commit hook blocks them.
4. Prefer surgical edits to existing files over creating new files.
5. Before claiming completion, run the verification command and show the output.
