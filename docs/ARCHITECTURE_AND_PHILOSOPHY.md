# Architecture and Philosophy

## Substrate

Atelier’s substrate is the fixed structure that drives each run: an optional prompt (which may include `{{context}}`), context injection from the accumulated world state, evaluation via the CreativeEvaluator, and termination via the promise string, max-iterations cap, and optional quality gate. Together these define how the agent sees the world and when it stops.

## Loop start

Each run begins with a human-supplied prompt and an optional seed. The prompt is stable across iterations; the seed can bootstrap initial code or parameters. The loop then repeatedly generates, evaluates, and accumulates until a termination condition is met.

## Curation

Users curate rather than micromanage: they control visibility (what the agent sees in context) and high-level control (prompt, limits, quality threshold). The system is designed so that curation of prompts and parameters shapes outcomes without requiring low-level editing of generated code.

## Full GUI

The primary interface is a full graphical UI where users start runs, view iterations, inspect the gallery, and export results. CLI and programmatic API remain available for automation and integration.

## Emergent recursion / computational life

The loop is a sandbox for self-improving, recursive behavior: the same prompt over a changing world can produce emergent refinement. The design tolerates (and optionally encourages) computational-life-style dynamics within safe bounds—sandboxed execution and clear termination prevent runaway or unsafe self-modification.

## Cloud and local LLMs

Atelier supports both cloud and local LLM backends. Users can use a hosted API (e.g. Inception) for speed and quality or run fully local (e.g. Ollama) for privacy and offline use; the loop and substrate are backend-agnostic.
